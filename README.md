# Command Line Pokemon Battle Game :zap: :cyclone: :collision:

## About

Welcome to my interpretation of a simple command line pokemon battle game.

I have built this game using JavaScript and Object Orientated Programming to create Classes and instances of these classes to build different Pokemon, Trainers and Battles.

This game can be played via the command line using inquirer.js. Instructions to set up the game are listed below.

My game lets the user build their own Trainer character and select pokemon to add to their storage. The user can then enter a battle with a villain trainer.

In each battle there is a running commentary on which pokemon is striking, what their damage to the other pokemon has been (dependent on the pokemon type) and how much health the opposing pokemon has left.

The initial game was build as part of a pair programming sprint after my first 3 weeks at the Northcoders Bootcamp. I have since revisited the code individually, refactored it and integrated the command line functionality.

## How to play

- Clone this repo and cd into the directory in your terminal
